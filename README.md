# üìÑ Description

This project consists of several exercises focused on creating a class hierarchy in Java for managing different types of workers. The exercises are as follows:

- **Exercise 1:** Create a class hierarchy with three classes: `Worker`, `OnlineWorker`, and `OnsiteWorker`. The `Worker` class includes attributes such as name, surname, and hourly rate, with a method to calculate salary based on hours worked.
- **Exercise 2:** Enhance the `OnlineWorker` and `OnsiteWorker` classes to override the salary calculation method, incorporating additional factors such as internet fees for online workers and gasoline costs for onsite workers.
- **Exercise 3:** Add deprecated methods in the child classes and demonstrate the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation, suppressing warnings in an external class while invoking these methods.
- **Exercise 4:** Use the main class to showcase the functionality of the class hierarchy and verify method overriding through demonstration.
